### Project Seven - 100DaysofCode
# CS Quiz Game
This is a simple program (game) which allows users to respond to five questions. 

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Create a while loop to allow the program restart after each play.
3. Create a score variable to hold the number of correct answers.
4. Using variables and if functions, collect user input and compare them against the correct answer for each question. 
5. Increase the score variable by one on each correct answer.
6. Print the score variable count.
7. Evaluate the while loop against user input to either restart or quit the program.
8. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* I learned to use the while loop to restart a program or run it again from scratch.
* I have gain better understanding to loops and how they can be applied in projects.
* I have learnt the application of the .lower() function in development.
